# Spectral Collocation Methods

The codes for the efficient numerical approximation of non-trivial stationary solutions of the microbial flocculation equations. Here, I developed numerical schemes based on finite difference and spectral collocation method. The results indicate that spectral collocation methods achieve much higher accuracy and rate of convergence compared to FD methods.
